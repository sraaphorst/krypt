# krypt

This is intended to be a library for math (particularly finite fields),
coding theory, and cryptography in Kotlin. Based on the book:

An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography, 2nd Ed
By Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, and Joseph H. Silverman

Not intended for serious use yet, but perhaps may evolve in this direction in the future. For now,
it is just a playground for me for implementing algorithms and libraries in Kotlin 2.0.
